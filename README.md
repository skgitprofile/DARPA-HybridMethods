# Hybrid Methods for Climate Systems
This project aims to develop coarse-scale and data-informed simulation methods that can accurately predict 
  statistical features of climate systems. The goal is to study long timescale features of climate dynamics 
  reliably without the use of expensive high resolution simulations, which are intractable over decadal timescales
  
  This work is funded by Defense Advanced research Projects Agency, as part of the AI-Assited Climate Tipping-point Modelling program.
